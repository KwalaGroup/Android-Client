# Kwala Android Client

### Installation

If you haven't already, you'll want to [download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Once that is finished, you should try to create and deploy an app so that you know everything is working before moving on. [This is a good tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) for how to get started making an app.

The Android client uses the programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) in conjunction with Java (industry standard). To work with the codebase, you'll want to install the Kotlin plugin and restart Android Studio. You can do this via:

```
Preferences -> Plugins -> Browse repositories -> Search for "Kotlin" -> Install
```

Once this is finished, you'll need to apply the plugin and restart Android Studio. You may need to sync Gradle afterwards as well. Android Studio should prompt you with a link if necessary.
