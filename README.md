# Kwala Android Client

### Installation

If you haven't already, you'll want to [download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Once that is finished, you should try to create and deploy an app so that you know everything is working before moving on. [This is a good tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) for how to get started making an app.

The Android client uses the programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) in conjunction with Java (industry standard). To work with the codebase, you'll want to install the Kotlin plugin and restart Android Studio. You can do this via:

```
Preferences -> Plugins -> Browse repositories -> Search for "Kotlin" -> Install
```

Once this is finished, you'll need to apply the plugin and restart Android Studio. 

### Opening the Project

To open the project correctly in Android Studio (assuming you have already cloned the repository), you will need to click on "Open an existing Android Studio project" if you are on the welcome screen, or `File -> Open Project...` if you already have another project open. It may take a minute or two for Android Studio to finish indexing, so it is recommended you wait for the dialog to dismiss and the spinner on the bottom window bar to disappear before continuing. You may need to sync Gradle afterwards as well. Android Studio should prompt you with a link if necessary.

At this point, if there are no errors, you should be good to go to work on the project.
